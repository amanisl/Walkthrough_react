TASK 3
Problem Statement
Explain the difference between npm and npx using the create-react-app code example.


Ans. npm and npx are both tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes.

npm (Node Package Manager) is used to install packages and manage dependencies.
If you want to create a React app using npm, you first have to install create-react-app globally,
then run the command:
Example: npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

* npx (Node Package Executor), on the other hand, allows you to run commands without needing to install them globally.
It fetches and runs the package directly. You can create a React app in one step without globally installing create-react-app:

--->>>Key Difference:<<<<---
npm requires globally installing the package first.
npx runs the package without installation, making it easier and cleaner for one-time usage.
